Hey, I’m Zaid

Cybersecurity Graduate | AI-Driven Security | Pen Testing | SOC Analyst (Entry-Level)

First-Class Cybersecurity Graduate passionate about securing the future of AI, IoT, blockchain, and quantum systems.
My final-year project (Distinction) demonstrated how layered IoT vulnerabilities (RFID, Wi-Fi, SSH) can be chained to compromise smart environments — using Proxmark3, Raspberry Pi, Aircrack-ng, Hydra, Nmap, and Hashcat to simulate real-world breaches.

Learning open-source intelligence, penetration testing, and system security, with strong foundations in networking, system administration (Windows/Linux/AD), and threat hunting.
Actively expanding my expertise through online courses in AI-driven threat intelligence, SOC operations, and emerging technologies at the convergence of AI, robotics, blockchain, and quantum computing.

Open to:

Internships or entry-level roles in cybersecurity, SOC, or AI security

Collaborations on open-source security and automation tools

Mentorship and learning opportunities in advanced threat intelligence
